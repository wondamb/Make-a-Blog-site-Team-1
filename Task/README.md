# Steps

  1. Choose a team member to start a new github repository to work on your project in. Assign the other team mate as a contributor and have them clone the repo to their local system.  

  2. Create your file structure. You will need 3 individual html files, 1 for each page of your blog website and one stlye.css file. 

  3. Link bootstrap & link your CSS style sheet on all HTML files.

  4. Create a Nav bar that links all three individual HTML files like in the Bad_Template and make sure it is the same style on all three pages.
  (Try using bootstrap for this)

  5. Make some content up for your home page! Pictures, random text, and/or videos! Whatever you can think of.
  (ex: Blogs about dogs, with lots of pictures and videos.)
  
  6. Make a footer that can be used for all three HTML pages, make sure the style and size are the same.

  7. Test run your website and polish it.
